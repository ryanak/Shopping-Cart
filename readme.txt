Basic shopping cart / checkout page - This script should show products, and then allow users to add them to their cart. When they checkout, the cart should include what the user purchased, and then take the users information (name, email and phone is sufficient). When the user clicks next, the user should be able to review key information. This information will be stored using the PHP session functionality. When the order is submitted an email is sent to the user and the order details are stored in a text file on ther server for processing.
