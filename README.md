Shopping cart / checkout page - This script shows products, and then allows users to add them to their cart. When they checkout, the cart includes what the user purchased, and then takes the user's information. When the user clicks next, the user is able to review key information. This information is stored using the PHP session functionality. When the order is submitted, an email is sent to the user and the order details are stored in a text file on the server for processing.
